======================
File-System-Service
======================

A computer-independent view and addressing scheme of a common folder.

Allows several computers to talk about the same folder structure 
(based on a root folder called "project folder"). This means translation
of path seperators etc. is handled.

Further features:

* Watch for file changes (currently based on polling)
* Hashing files (SHA-512)


Why not just use java File?
-----------------------------

The FSS is based on File, but a File object is not exchangable between
computers.
